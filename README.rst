==========
Translator
==========

Translator is a tool for verifying recursive C programs via source-to-source 
program transformation. It uses a recursion-free program analyzer CPAChecker
as a black box and computes function summaries from the inductive invariants
generated by CPAChecker. Such function summaries enable Translator to check
recursive programs.

Currently this project is unstable.
Experimental release_ for 2015 Competition on 
Software Verification will be available soon.
