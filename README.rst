CPArec
======

CPArec is a tool for verifying recursive C programs via source-to-source 
program transformation. It uses a recursion-free program analyzer CPAChecker
as a black box and computes function summaries from the inductive invariants
generated by CPAChecker_. Such function summaries enable CPArec to check
recursive programs.

Currently this project is unstable.
An experimental version `CPArec-v0.1-alpha`__ for 2015 Competition on 
Software Verification is available now.

__ `Prebuilt Release`_

-----
Usage
-----

Download and extract our release.

To analyze a C program, please type::

  $ python <path/to/>CPArec/main.py <path/to/>program.c
  
CPArec will print verification result on the screen and indicate the directory 
where proof is stored.
  
For further usage help, please type::

  $ python <path/to/>CPArec/main.py -h
