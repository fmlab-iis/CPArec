Translator
==========

Translator is a tool for verifying recursive C programs via source-to-source 
program transformation. It uses a recursion-free program analyzer CPAChecker
as a black box and computes function summaries from the inductive invariants
generated by CPAChecker. Such function summaries enable Translator to check
recursive programs.

Currently this project is unstable.
A experimental version translator-0.1 for 2015 Competition on Software Verification
will be available soon.
